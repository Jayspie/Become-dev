# Become DEV

## What is this 
I want to show my growth as a developer as I reach my goal of becoming a developer

## Why
I've been coding since 2016, but I haven't made any progress in my skills. So, I decided today is the day I achieved my dream. 

By the end of this year or the beginning of next year, I want to have five projects completed and start applying to Software/Web Development jobs
## Update log
<h5>March 17,2024</h5>

Recently, I finished [learning SQL](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-sql) on Codecademy earlier this week, and all I have to say is, 'Not too bad.' It's not something I'm looking to do as a career, but it's good to know. I'm currently [learning Javascript](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/create-a-back-end-app-with-javascript) to build APIs and how the backend works. After this course, or when I feel ready, I will start working on my first project.

Also, I posted my first blog post on [Dev](https://dev.to/jayspie/become-a-dev-28b8). It was an enjoyable experience, and I'm planning to do more in the future.

Thanks for reading.
