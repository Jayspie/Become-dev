# Become DEV

This will show my growth into becoming a Dev by the in of the year. 

## Why
I've been coding since 2016, but I haven't made any progress when it comes to my skills. So I decided today is the day where I achieve my dream. 

By the end of this year and beginning of next year I wan to have 5 project completed and started applying to Software/Web Development jobs

## Project list 
- Clock-in/out app
- Portfolio Website
- Virtual multiplayer piano
- Music suggestion bot

These are just a few projects I will like to make. I will add more in the future once I think of them.
